"""eFEL Python API functions.

This module provides the user-facing Python API of the eFEL.
The convenience functions defined here call the underlying 'cppcore' library
to hide the lower level API from the user.
All functions in this module can be called as efel.functionname, it is
not necessary to include 'api' as in efel.api.functionname.
