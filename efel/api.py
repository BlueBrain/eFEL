"""eFEL Python API functions.

This module provides the user-facing Python API of the eFEL.
The convenience functions defined here call the underlying 'cppcore' library
to hide the lower level API from the user.
All functions in this module can be called as efel.functionname, it is
not necessary to include 'api' as in efel.api.functionname.

    This function is the core of the eFEL API. A list of traces (in the form

    names.

    The return value consists of a list of dictionaries, one for each input
    trace. The keys in the dictionaries are the names of the calculated
    features, the corresponding values are lists with the feature values.
    Beware that every feature returns an array of values. E.g. AP_amplitude
    will return a list with the amplitude of every action potential.

    Parameters
